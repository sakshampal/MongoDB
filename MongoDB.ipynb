    "    Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management\n",
    "    systems that are designed to handle various types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.\n",
    "    They do not rely on the traditional tabular structure of relational databases and do not require a fixed schema. \n",
    "    Instead, they allow for more flexible and dynamic data models.\n",
    "    NoSQL databases are typically used for handling large-scale, distributed, and rapidly changing data, making them \n",

    "    when dealing with evolving or unpredictable data models, making it easier to adapt to changing application requirements.\n",
